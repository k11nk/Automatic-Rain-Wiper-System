# Automatic-Rain-Wiper-System
The Automatic Rain Wiper System is a practical project utilizing an Arduino Nano to automate windshield wiper action in response to rain. This system employs a rain sensor to detect moisture, activating a servo motor to mimic the sweeping motion of traditional wipers, enhancing visibility and safety during rainy conditions.
